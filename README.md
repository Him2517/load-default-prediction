# load-default-prediction
We developed a machine learning model to forecast loan defaults in this project. Our process involved conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, followed by preprocessing, feature extraction, and oversampling using SMOTE. Finally, we constructed the models to generate classification reports.
